In the control group, without conscious observation, we would expect to see an interference pattern on the screen, indicating the wave-like behavior of particles. In contrast, in the experimental group, with conscious observation, we would expect to see a collapse of the interference pattern and a more localized distribution of particle positions, indicating the particle-like behavior.\n",

However, it is important to note that this experiment alone may not be sufficient to fully confirm or refute the hypothesis. Further studies and replication of the experiment by different researchers would be necessary to establish the validity of the hypothesis.\n",
